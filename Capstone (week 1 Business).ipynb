Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Chinese Restaurant** in **New York**, The USA.\n\nSince there are lots of cafes in Berlin we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Chinese restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."

In NY, you can find people from various countries and different cultural backgrounds.\n\nAs a Chinese/Asian food lover, I decided to do a primary research to discover whether there are some places in the center of NewYork to operate a Chinese restaurant. I hope this report could help the stakeholders to find a business solution and introduce this kind of delicious food to the lovely people in NY."
